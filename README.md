# Hi, I'm MaeF41 

- I love to solve issues and coding is just a tool to help me
- Coding for the long run means to protect myself to not to loose the curiosity
- Thai box, games, socializing and theatre (or art in general) is my way to wind off
- I like TDD approach and if I am not pressured to cut corners 100% test coverage is my priority
- Aspiring Full Stack developer (I am a frontend developer, but I have some shallow backend experience)
